Use the '<b>Spacy Custom Training.ipynb</b>' file to prepare the data and train the model.

I have also attached my trained model in the model folder.


Based on my Training, I was able to identify and extract key words like phone number, email, customer name and product name.
So, Similar to that, we can train the model based on different requirements. But need more data to increase the model accuracy.

This is the short output I received while testing.
